This is a thank you file from the Sun++ team to the Moon++ team for all their work,
that they have granted us to use as a base to start off instead of making us start
from scratch. Special thanks to M4ksiu for the permission, and most of the work in
the scripts.

History: I will update this as soon as some Moon++ dev informs me, all i know is that they 
stopped in Summer 2008 and started somewhere in 2007, and that devs stopped updating, last
standing man was dev M4ksiu, probably most active from what i can tell, stopped developing
for public because apparently HyntDB (RusDB) stealed without crediting their scripts.

We started work on the last release on svn from them, wich you will find in a rar file. 
Unfortunately we dont have a svn log to bundle with it, im hoping some Moon++ dev will
provide it since anonymous account isnt working anymore.
We have not touched any credits, we will only add ours if we update a script.

The biggest respect to this team for all the great work they have done, that we all enjoy.
