this is a a diploma for a noob project :D

Instead of makeing a proper project we simulate the walking of a player to enhance a basic Vmap to include a minimal corection using objects spawned on it.
The difference of using this instead of Collision system is that. It will require less resources and chances to crash while it does support a basic heightmap for things that need it.

- run in executables somewhat in this order in client folder :
	- ad.exe -> extracts into "maps"
	- vmapextract_v2.exe -> extracts into "vmaps"
	- vmap_assembler.exe -> 
	- landwalker.exe -> extracts into "maps_out"
