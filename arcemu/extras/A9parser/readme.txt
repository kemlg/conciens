to use :
1) you need a file named "SMSG_COMPRESSED_UPDATE_OBJECT.txt" or "SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT.txt" in step2 dir
2) simply run uncompress.bat

Results :
 - in step3 dir there will be the blocks separated in file
 - in main dir there will be a9_human_form.txt which will show what happened in each update/create block

 !Not that only units/players/GOs are processed in humna form.
